# üëú Expensive Bags Store ‚Äì NOVI Frontend Module

This repository contains my solution for the **Expensive Bags Store** exercise from the Frontend Development module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).  
The goal of this assignment is to practice working with **React components** and **props** by refactoring a webshop into reusable, data-driven components without changing the visual design.

The focus is on creating flexible, reusable UI building blocks such as **Buttons**, **Products**, and **Tiles**, while maintaining existing styling through semantic HTML elements.
